In Short,

gender identity and expression
age
sexual orientation
disability
physical appearance
body size
race
ethnicity
nationality

previous hackathon attendance or lack of
computing experience or lack of
chosen programming language or tech stack
We do not tolerate harassment of hackathon participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at any hackathon venue, this includes the following.

hacks
talks, presentations, or demos
workshops
any parties associated to the hackathon
social media
any other online media
Hackathon participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the hackathon without a refund (if applicable) at the discretion of the hackathon organisers.

We ask that our participants respect each others' privacy. We ask that you obtain the permission of other participants before screen-shotting, recording, or capturing audio/video. Participants can also optionally change their Discord nickname/username and add "(No photos please!)" to make this clear.

The longer version
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion or political views, sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

As this is a hackathon, we like to explicitly note that the hacks created at our hackathon are equally subject to the anti-harassment policy.

Sponsors and partners are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Sponsor representatives (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of hackathon staff immediately.

Hackathon organizers will be happy to help participants contact any local security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the hackathon. We value your attendance.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the hackathon organisers may take any action they deem appropriate. This includes warning the offender, expulsion from the hackathon with no refund (if applicable), or reporting their behaviour to local law enforcement.

We expect participants to follow these rules on any TerribleHack affiliated pages, groups, venues, etc.

Harassment may be reported at any time by contacting the hackathon organizers on our Facebook Page, or on Discord via a Ticket.
